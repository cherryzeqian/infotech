    <h1>ABOUT THE LIVING GARDEN</h1>
    <p class="about-hero-text">
      The Living Garden is a small educational website created for kids ages 8–12.
      It connects real science—about plants, seasons, and city parks—to everyday
      experiences in gardens, playgrounds, and schoolyards.

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p class="about-intro">
      Our team worked together to design different parts of the site. Each member
      focused on a special section but also helped review the whole project so
      the pages feel like one story.

  <!-- How to Use card -->
  <section class="card about-card">
    <h2>How to Use This Site</h2>
    <p>
      Kids can start on the <strong>Garden</strong> page to see how one tree changes
      with the weather. Then they can visit <strong>Hard Facts</strong> to learn the
      science behind what they see.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Personal Diary</strong> lets them record their own observations.
      <strong>Beyond Garden</strong> shows how parks across New York City also
      connect people and nature. Together, these pages encourage young learners to
      look more closely at the living world around them.
